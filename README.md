# easy_cryptostorm_manager
#This short script is to make easier to manage the vpns after you unzip the ovpn files inside 
#After you follow instructions with the terminal on https://cryptostorm.is/nix it might not work at all
#You need to move all the .ovpn files that you got from configs.zip you need to copy or move all of them 
#To this path: /etc/openvpn/client
#After that you should be able to load the vpn: sudo openvpn --config /etc/openvpn/client/thecountrygoeshere_UDP.ovpn
#You can also try our script called vpn.sh
